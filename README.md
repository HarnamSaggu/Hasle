# Hasle
A very non-non-hassle free language to use!!!<br>
Programming my own language has been a dream of mine for years, and I'm really glad to have written 2 now (the first being a rudimentary proof of concept).<br>
I hope to learn how to actually write a language properly, instead of hacking it together.<br>
(Although hacking it together is its own little achievement)<br>
